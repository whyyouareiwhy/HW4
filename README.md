<p>This homework went pretty smoothly since it's basically applying everything
we have learned into one big assignment. I really enjoyed working on this.
Reviewing the past homeworks definitely helped, but I still ended up doing a
little research for a few things here and there.</p>

<p>The only thing that gave me some trouble, was the damn envelope. I probably
spent as much time on that part as I did the rest of the homework. I ended up just
moving on to work on the project instead. </p>

<p>I wouldn't change much about the project if I were to keep working on it, I 
would just keep expanding the functionality a little bit. I would also get the
envelope working because the popping is really annoying.</p>
